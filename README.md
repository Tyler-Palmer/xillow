## Xillow

This is a collaborative full-stack project made by [Duc Pham](https://github.com/mouseduc12) and [Tyler Palmer](https://github.com/Tyler-Palmer). The aim was to create a website similar to Zillow's website and functionality, but as we proceeded we hit certain limitations and evolved with restrictions and data availability.
