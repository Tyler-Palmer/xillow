Their home, a modern masterpiece that Mad Men's Don Draper would undoubtedly drool over, was the hub of many social gatherings and bridge tournaments, with Helen earning the designation of Life Master bridge player. Signs of a life well-lived are everywhere. .. from the numerous bowling trophies lining the shelves, the decor and trinkets from their travels across the globe, to the library filled with old, worn, well-read books. The energy of the home sizzles and the walls tell stories of glitz, glamour, joy and laughter. This home although dated, has the bones of an absolute work of art and is crying to be restored to her full potential and previous glory days. However, regardless of the fate of this home, the grounds alone are worth the pricetag. .. one acre in the most coveted neighborhood in all of Salt Lake.
