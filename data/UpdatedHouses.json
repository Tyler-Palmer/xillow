        "description": "Step back in time with this mid century time capsule. So legit that it's been recently used for the set of movies and films. Once the home of the lovely Helen and Edward who enjoyed over 42 years of love and friendship together and raised two precocious children. When they weren't busy hitting golf balls and playing tennis at the Cottonwood Club, they developed and managed numerous commercial properties across Salt Lake as well as founded several international merchandise businesses. Their home, a modern masterpiece that Mad Men's Don Draper would undoubtedly drool over, was the hub of many social gatherings and bridge tournaments, with Helen earning the designation of Life Master bridge player. Signs of a life well-lived are everywhere. .. from the numerous bowling trophies lining the shelves, the decor and trinkets from their travels across the globe, to the library filled with old, worn, well-read books. The energy of the home sizzles and the walls tell stories of glitz, glamour, joy and laughter. This home although dated, has the bones of an absolute work of art and is crying to be restored to her full potential and previous glory days. However, regardless of the fate of this home, the grounds alone are worth the pricetag. .. one acre in the most coveted neighborhood in all of Salt Lake. Not only that, but this is also unquestionably one of the best and most secluded lots in all of Walker Estates. .. with the added bonus of a seasonal stream which flows along the length of the backyard, adding peace and magic to the air. The possibilities of what could be created here are beyond exciting, and if the lucky visionary who buys this estate wants to invite me over someday for drinks and a game of bridge, I'll be sure to wear my shiny pants and bring a plate of brownies!",

Essentially everything in this house is new or refinished, and as maintenance free as possible. Tastefully completed, with practicality in mind. For such a small home it has tons of storage and a laundry room that you won't want to leave. Beautiful hardwood floors have either been refinished or totally replaced. Every inch of this spectacular kitchen has been thought through for max use of space, with new soft close cabinets in white Shaker style, the latest and greatest in granite with the new Satin finish and thick straight edge. Light and bright with dimming canned lights and under counter LED lighting. An island bar has been completed with the busy person in mind. Use as a computer area with power and USB outlets or just a place to grab a quick bite w a TV in the corner. The best part is the outdoor living. Large covered patio completely rebuilt with 8 can lights, bead board ceiling and a fan for hot summer nights. Convenient to the spacious backyard and fenced garden. Wired for that hot tub you've wanted with a 220v line. Landscaping was totally ripped out and replaced. All new sod, trees, shrubs bushes and perennial plants. Too many things to list-See document for a full list of improvements. It's ready to just move in this week! Square footage figures are provided as a courtesy estimate only and were obtained from previous listings . Buyer is advised to obtain an independent measurement. Agent is related to owner.",

Every time I drive home and see the Wasatch Mountains framed in my window as I wind up the cul de sac it puts a smile on my face. There's hardly a room in the house without a view of the city or mountains. This location and neighborhood are hard to match. Easy access to the I-215 belt route and Big/Little Cottonwood Canyons are just a stone throw away. This means quick and easy access to the mountains, airport, downtown, Park City and more. Both grade school and junior high have been rebuilt and the high school is under construction. The City of Cottonwood Heights has a lot going on!  The Turkey Trot, Butlerville Days parade, carnival, and fireworks display, just to name a few! Ride your bike or walk to the Rec center just down the road. Fun Fact - We purchased this house from the actor Chris Pratt (Guardian of the Galaxy, Jurassic Park. )  Too much to list with this home so you need to see it for yourself!  Showings to begin January 4, 2019!  Click on tour and check out the 3D walk through. Owner Agent",

The location offers easy access to Interstate 15, shopping, dining, entertainment and more! Pheasant Meadow Park and Bellevue Park are within walking distance of this incredible home. The yard is beautifully landscaped and huge! You won't believe the curb appeal. Enter into a formal living room with 15-foot coffered ceilings. It's the perfect place to greet your guests. A home office (which could be converted to a bedroom) is located just off the formal living room. The floor plan flows in this property right into a large great room with vaulted ceilings, a cozy fireplace and easy access to a massive covered patio in the back yard. Fall in love with the kitchen's artistic knotty alder cabinetry and granite countertops. A Wolf Range makes meal preparation a sheer delight. We can't wait for you to see the sweet breakfast nook surrounded by a bay box window overlooking a large, meticulously-landscaped back yard. The laundry room is conveniently located on the main floor. From this home's center you can also access a 4-car garage, a fabulous feature. Did we mention this home has wood, tile and travertine floors throughout? The main floor master bedroom features a fireplace, large walk-in closet and a full bath equipped with double vanities and a separate tub and shower. The walkout basement is equipped with a second kitchen, a giant family room and another lovely fireplace. There is storage galore in the basement with built-in shelving. You will even enjoy a workout room. Call us today for a private showing. We are so excited for you to experience the mountain views!",

        "description": "Utah sunshine fills this massive kitchen/dining area with warmth and light year round. This room is the perfect place to raise a family. There is something so comforting about the towering mountain peeking through large windows. Wildlife meanders through the yard, particularly deer. Whether you watch them through the kitchen window or from the massive rooftop deck, their beauty is astounding. Life looks great from the top of the world. That's where you will think you are when you step out onto the deck. It's like one big family room opened to the sky. This home, high on the east bench, was built for a family! Large spaces encourage gatherings. Keep the family all together on the second floor where five bedrooms and three bathrooms are well-equipped for children. Two master bedrooms offer massive closets and the entire home features built-in shelves for instant organization. Wood floors are easy to maintain. A bonus room off the second master makes this the perfect place to accommodate special guests. Bedrooms in the 100% finished basement offer a little distance and privacy. In the family room, an entire wall of custom cupboards, a desk, drawers and book shelves encourage young students to study. The 2-car attached garage is huge with yet more room for storage! The huge yard is fully landscaped. Decks on the front and back of the house will give you room to soak it all in! This Avenues neighborhood is highly coveted. Walk to the 11th Avenue Park with the kids and dogs to enjoy time alone or with an entire community of children and adults who love to play soccer, run and laugh. This convenient location offers easy access to downtown, shopping, entertainment, recreation and a beeline to world-class ski resorts! Call us, will you? We can't wait to welcome you to your new home.",
